# My Utils

## Project introduction

I want to create a very popular tool module. 

So there are a lot of tools and functions that I think are very practical, which can speed up my development efficiency.😁👍

## Use this Project

```bash
go get -u github.com/iWyh2/go-myUtils
```

## Introduction to tool functions

### 1. Clear

I use this function a lot.
Generally used when a terminal program is started, the other contents of the terminal are clear, so that the entire terminal only has the content of the current program.

### 2. UUID

This function is used to generate UUID.🤔

### The other...

The library already has two utility functions.
I am also constantly looking for tools that can improve the efficiency of development. I hope this library will get bigger and I hope this library can help you.😉

Please look forward to💕
